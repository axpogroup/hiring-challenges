# Data Platform Engineer Challenge

## Introduction

Axpo has ambitions goals to become a data-driven company.
To achieve this, we need to build a modern data platform that enable
data scientists, data engineers, and business users
to access, analyze, and consume data in a secure and efficient way.

To do so, we need your help to design and implement a data platform.

## Your Mission, Should You Choose to Accept It:

### Initial position

Start from scratch. Given is only the companies structure and culture.

Imagine Axpo as a company with many diverse teams, departments and even subsidiaries all over the world.
Some of them are very advanced and may already have a data platform of some sort,
while others are just getting started to collect and analyze data.

Technology wise, Axpo's new Dataplatform should be built on top of Azure Databricks.


### Rules

* read the whole README.md carefully
* don't spend more than 1 hour on each task
* don't solve everything, focus on what you think is most important
* be creative and pragmatic
* be prepared to present your results and answer questions
* no need to hand in the results before the interview


### Task 1: 👩‍🎨 Design a Data Platform

Time to get creative! There are many things to consider when designing a data platform
and there are many ways to do it. We want to see how you would do it.

In max. 5 slides, please draft a very high-level architecture of your data platform design.
Include some of your own thoughts like:

* how can teams share data with each other?
* how do you onboard new platform users?
* who is responsible for what?
* much more ...

Please pitch task 1 in a non-technical way (max. 5 minutes).


### Task 2: 🕵️‍♂️ It's all about the details

Choose one topic / thought from Task 1 and go into more detail.
What is your design idea in detail? How would you solve it? How does it scale?
How does it influence other parts of the platform?

Impress us with your ability to solve complex problems with pragmatic solutions (max. 5 minutes).


### Task 3: 👷 Implementation phase

Pick a small part of your design (doesn't need to be related with task 2) and implement it in Terraform.
The Terraform code musst not be runnable, but it should be clear what you want to achieve 
and how you would structure your code.

Get your hands dirty and show us your code (no slides, max. 5 minutes).


# THE END

We're looking forward to your results and are excited to discuss them with you.

Good luck and have fun! 🚀
