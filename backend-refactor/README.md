This application is a backend that provides endpoints around Signals data. A tech enthusiast on the business side has been maintaining this application, now the IT department has been tasked with taking it over. 

Initial Assessment: 
The code quality is low, the previous developer was copying/pasting from tutorials.

Todo: 
- Productionalise this application (This is purposely vague, implement what you think is necessary for this small application to work on prod)
- Spend around 4-6 hours on this, document how you spent your time.
